Since, lexical diversity is a measure of different words appear in text, it would make sense that the musical genre's of Hip Hop or Folk music would have a higher lexical diversity than Pop which tends to use more repetitive and simpler language. Both Cher and Robyn are primarily pop artists and therefore might have lower lexical diversity. The difference or lack there of in lexical diversity between the artists do conform to my prior beliefs. Since they are both pop singers there would be little difference in their lexical diversity.\n"
